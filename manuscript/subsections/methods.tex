\subsection{Model of initial transcription}
Our model is based on a minimal scheme for initial transcription, containing
reactions for i) the NAC, ii) backtracking (the
first unscrunching step), iii) promoter escape, and iv) unscrunching and
abortive RNA release (Figure \ref{fig:model_and_rates}A). The rate constant
for backtracking is calculated assuming that the AP at a template position is
equal to the probability of backtracking. Since backtracking is in kinetic
competition only with the NAC, the NAC will proceed with probability 100\% -
AP. Thus, for a given rate constant of the NAC, we calculate the rate
constant of backstepping as follows:
\begin{equation}
  b = \frac{\text{NAC}\cdot\text{AP}}{1-\text{AP}}.
  \label{fig:backtrackingcalc}
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:model_and_rates}B shows the initial transcription kinetic
scheme together with placeholder values for the estimated rate constants.

In this work we use APs obtained both for the absence of GreB (-GreB) and in
the presence of GreB (+GreB). When GreB is present, backtracked complexes may
be rescued by GreB stimulated cleavage of the unaligned 3\ppp end of the
transcript. Therefore, APs obtained in the presence of GreB represent the
probability to both backstep and to avoid rescue by GreB until abortive RNA
release. We assume that GreB-mediated cleavage and subsequent NACs are rapid
steps compared to unscrunching, using the APs obtained in the presence of GreB
as effective backstepping probabilities.

\subsection{Implementation and parameter estimation}
The data used for parameter estimation is the distribution of time spent in
abortive cycling \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. This data was obtained from
100 individual initial transcription events. For such low copy-number
experiments, there is an inherent stochastic component in the experimental
outcome that derives from the randomness of molecular motion. Indeed,
single-molecule experiments of the rate of transcription elongation show large
standard deviations \cite{adelman_single_2002,
tolic-norrelykke_diversity_2004}. We therefore simulate initial transcription
using stochastic simulations. To solve the kinetic scheme we use the direct
method for the stochastic simulation algorithm \cite{gillespie_exact_1977} as
implemented in the StocPY software \cite{maarleveld_stochpy:_2013}. 

We estimate the rate constants in two-step proceedure. In the first step, we
randomly sample 50000 triplets of the rate constants for promoter escape,
unscrunching and abortive RNA release. We then use the value for the NAC to
calculate rate constants for backtracking through formula
\eqref{eq:fig:backtrackingcalc}. We simulate
100 initial transcription events to find the predicted distribution of time
spent in abortive cycling for each set of rate constants. This distribution is
then compared to the measured values from Revaykin et.\ al
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006} using the root mean squared distance metric. The
resulting fits are ranked by the metric distance, (lower is better). The
full proceedure is illustrated in Figure S\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_scheme}.

    open complex (OC) transcription proceeds by nucleotide additions cycles
    from one initial transcribing complex (IC) to the next, where each IC is
    identified in subscript by the length of its nascent RNA. Initial
    transcription proceeds until the nascent RNA has reached the
    experimentally obtained maximum size of abortive transcript (MSAT)
    \cite{hsu_initial_2006}. For ICs with an 2nt RNA or longer, there is a
    competition between the nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) and backstepping.
    Backstepping leads to a backtracked state from which further backtracking
    and abortive RNA release occurs, returning RNAP to the open complex. From
    the open complex forward transcription may resume once more. B) Kinetic
