Transcription needs to start somewhere. Sometimes, the start is a bit rough,
and transcription needs to try again. How many times it tries again can vary
with the DNA sequence in the beginning. The name of try to get transcription
going, but failing and having to try again many times, is called the beginning
of transcription. People have done lots of studies on the beginning of
transcription, and they have shown many things (I can write a list of these
things). But some things are extra difficult to find with
experiments, for example the speed of the different stages during beginning
transcription. The reason why it is difficult is that some of the steps in
beginning transcription are fast, and the machines that are used in
experiments can many times not measure fast things.

Here, we have made a computer model of initial transcription that is special
made to fit experiments very well. This allows us to use a computer to find
speeds during beginning transcription kinetics of the beginning of
transcription. This is great!
