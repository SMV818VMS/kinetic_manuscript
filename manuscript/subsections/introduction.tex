Points:

* Review of kinetic experiments of initial transcription (single molecule and
ensemble; with the limitations of both; sensitivity and time-resolution), as
well kinetic modeling (Xue; did they use michaelise menten rates corresponding
to 1000 $\mu$M?). Mention a word about elongation experiments, of which there
are several.

* Review backtracking, contrasting elongation with initiation.

* Review AP in relation to backtracking, mention GreB. Review the strengths
and weaknesses of AP: when using GreB the probability to backtrack is not
changed, but cleavage happens before abortive product release.

*Several single-molecule studies of initial transcription have been undertaken
\cite{margeat_direct_2006,revyakin_abortive_2006,kapanidis_retention_2005}.
By following single transcription events with high accuracy, the results of
these studies can be well suited for informing computational models of
transcription.
