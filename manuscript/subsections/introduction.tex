Transcription of DNA is at the core of cellular metabolism and a highly
regulated process at multiple levels. In bacteria, transcription is performed
by a single RNAP, which when associated with a $\sigma$ factor can identify
and bind to promoter regions of DNA, forming a DNA bubble and the RNAP-DNA
open complex. RNAP is still bound to the promoter during the first steps of
RNA synthesis and its translocation occurs by the mechanism of scrunching
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, kapanidis_initial_2006}, where DNA is pulled
into RNAP to expose the enzyme's active site for NTP binding. This causes the
DNA bubble to grow by one base pair for each NTP added to the RNA's growing
3\ppp end, until it has synthesized an RNA of 8-15 nt in length,
\cite{carpousis_cycling_1980,hsu_vitro_2003,tang_real-time_2009,hsu_initial_2006},
where it may break promoter bonds,  entering the phase of productive
transcription elongation. However, not all initial transcription attempts
result in promoter escape. At any position before escape is reached, RNAP may
instead release the nascent RNA and fall back to the open complex formation,
from where transcription may be re-initiated \cite{carpousis_cycling_1980}.
The process of repeated RNA synthesis and abortive release is known as
abortive cycling. It has been shown that the extent of abortive cycling
depends on the sequence context of both the core promoter region and the
initial transcribed sequence (ITS) \cite{hsu_initial_2006, hsu_promoter_2002,
vo_vitro_2003}.

The complete picture of the mechanisms involved in initial transcription is
not fully understood. In particular, the reaction steps that precede abortive
RNA release, and their kinetics, have not yet been determined. For instance, we
do not know whether the speed of transcription differs between the promotor
bound stage (translocation by scrunching) and the elongating stage
(translocation by base-stepping). To fully understand transcription
regulation, we need to further explore the dynamics of initial transcription. 

It is known so far that some or all abortive RNA releases are associated with
the step of backtracking. This step constitutes a reverse motion where RNAP
releases scrunched DNA, forcing the nascent RNA 3\ppp end to extrude into the
NTP entry channel. Backtracking is strongly associated with abortive RNA
release, since the amount of abortive product is reduced in the presence of
GreB, a protein that rescues backtracked complexes by stimulating RNAP's
intrinsic RNA cleavage activity
\cite{hsu_initial_2006,hsu_escherichia_1995,feng_grea-induced_1994}.

The current conceptual model of abortive cycling consists of the progressive
steps of scrunching and nucleotide addition (together referred to as the
nucleotide addition cycle, NAC), and the regressive steps of backtracking,
unscrunching, and abortive RNA release. Early kinetic work with bulk
transcription experiments on the \textit{lac} UV5 promoter showed a half-life
of full length RNA synthesis on short DNA templates of 1 minute, and that
promoter-binding was not the rate-limiting step \cite{stefano_lac_1979}. Given
the short length of the templates, this implied a rate-limiting step between
promoter binding and promoter escape. It was soon after shown that the
time-delay for full length RNA synthesis coincided with the synthesis of large
quantities of short abortive transcripts, which implied abortive cycling as
the rate limiting step \cite{munson_abortive_1981}. Recent knowledge about the
kinetics of initial transcription has come largely from single-molecule
experiments \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, kapanidis_initial_2006,
tang_real-time_2009, kapanidis_retention_2005, margeat_direct_2006}. For
bacterial RNAP, it has been found that the backtracking and abortive RNA
release steps are slow relative to forward translocation and RNA synthesis
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, margeat_direct_2006}, but so far the exact
kinetic difference of these steps has not been quantified. The most detailed
description of the kinetics of initial transcription in bacteria is the
characterization of the time RNAP spends in abortive cycling on the N25
promoter in the presence of GreB \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. This work
showed that RNAP spends between 3 and 20 seconds in abortive cycling over a
stretch of 11 bp of DNA before achieving promoter escape
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}.

By proposing the rate limiting steps and finding the distribution of time
spent in abortive cycling, single-molecule experiments have revealed a general
kinetic picture of initial transcription. However, their time-resolution has
not yet been sufficient for distinguishing the rate constants for the
individual steps of backtracking, unscrunching, and abortive RNA release. Moreover,
while these methods have been used to quantify the speed of transcription for
transcription elongation \cite{wang_force_1998,
tolic-norrelykke_diversity_2004}, their relatively low temporal resolution
have yet not allowed the identification of the speed of the NAC during initial
transcription \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, margeat_direct_2006}.

Although single-molecule experiments can reveal highly detailed information
about the movement and position of single RNAPs during initial transcription,
traditional bulk experiments must still be used to quantify the relative molar
abundance of abortive transcripts. By knowing the relative abundance of each
abortive RNA species, one may calculate the probability of producing an
abortive transcript of any given length, known as the abortive probability
(AP) \cite{hsu_promoter_2002, hsu_quantitative_1996}. Since backtracking is a
starting point for abortive RNA releases, bulk transcription experiments
therefore provide a position-specific indication of the likelihood of
backtracking during initial transcription. In the present study, we have
created a kinetic model of initial transcription that combines the abortive
probabilities obtained from steady state bulk experiments with
time-distribution of abortive cycling from single-molecule experiments. We
inferred from this model the rate constants for the NAC and the combined step
of unscrunching and abortive RNA release. Our results indicate two important
notions: 1) the speed of the NAC is the same for promoter-bound RNAP as
for promoter-free RNAP following promoter escape, and 2) the rate of NAC is 10
times faster than the unscrunching and abortive RNA release, confirming the
results from other studies that have suggested that these steps are
rate limiting for promoter escape.
