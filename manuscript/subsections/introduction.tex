Transcription of DNA is at the core of cellular metabolism and a highly
regulated process at multiple levels. In bacteria, transcription is performed
by a single RNAP, which when associated with a $\sigma$ factor can identify
and bind to promoter regions of DNA. After promoter binding, a part of DNA
including the transcription start site is melted, forming a DNA bubble and the
RNAP-DNA open complex, from where RNA synthesis may proceed. RNAP is still
bound to the promoter during the first steps of RNA synthesis and can
therefore not translocate downstream the template as it does during
transcription elongation. Instead, translocation during initial transcription
occurs by the mechanism of scrunching \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006,
kapanidis_initial_2006}, where DNA is pulled into RNAP to expose the enzyme's
active site for NTP binding. This causes the DNA bubble to grow by one base
pair for each NTP added to the RNA's growing 3\ppp end. After having
gone through several rounds of scrunching to synthesize an RNA of 8-15 nt in
length,
\cite{carpousis_cycling_1980,hsu_vitro_2003,tang_real-time_2009,hsu_initial_2006},
RNAP may break promoter bonds and enter the phase of productive transcription
elongation. However, not all initial transcription attempts result in promoter
escape. At any position before escape is reached, RNAP may instead release the
nascent RNA and fall back to the open complex formation, from where RNAP may
initiate transcription once more \cite{carpousis_cycling_1980}. The process of
repeated RNA synthesis and abortive release is known as abortive cycling. It
has been shown that the extent of abortive cycling depends on the sequence
context of both the core promoter region and the initial transcribed
sequence (ITS) \cite{hsu_initial_2006, hsu_promoter_2002, vo_vitro_2003}.

The reaction steps that precede abortive RNA release have not been fully
determined. What is known so far is that some or all abortive RNA releases
involve the step of backtracking. Backtracking constitutes a reverse motion
where RNAP releases scrunched DNA, forcing the nascent RNA 3\ppp end to
extrude into the NTP entry channel. The evidence for the involvement of
backtracking in abortive RNA release is that the amount of abortive product is
reduced in the presence of GreB, a protein that rescues backtracked complexes
by stimulating RNAP's intrinsic RNA cleavage activity
\cite{hsu_initial_2006,hsu_escherichia_1995,feng_grea-induced_1994}.

The current conceptual model of abortive cycling therefore consists of the
progressive steps of scrunching and nucleotide addition (together referred to
as the nucleotide addition cycle, NAC), and the regressive steps of
backtracking, unscrunching, and abortive RNA release. In this model, little is
known about the kinetics of the individual steps. Early work with bulk
transcription experiments on the \textit{lac} UV5 promoter showed a half-life
of full length RNA synthesis on short DNA templates of 1 minute, and that
promoter-binding was not the rate-limiting step \cite{stefano_lac_1979}. Given
the short length of the templates, this implied a rate-limiting step between
promoter binding and promoter escape. It was soon after shown that the
time-delay for full length RNA synthesis coincided with the synthesis of large
quantities of short abortive transcripts, which implied abortive cycling as
the rate limiting step \cite{munson_abortive_1981}. Recent knowledge about the
kinetics of initial transcription has come largely from single-molecule
experiments \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, kapanidis_initial_2006,
tang_real-time_2009, kapanidis_retention_2005, margeat_direct_2006}. For
bacterial RNAP, it has been found that the backtracking and abortive RNA
release steps are slow relative to forward translocation and RNA synthesis
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, margeat_direct_2006}, but so far the exact
kinetic difference of these steps has not been quantified. The most detailed
description of the kinetics of initial transcription in bacteria is the
characterization of the time RNAP spends in abortive cycling on the N25
promoter in the presence of GreB \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. This work
showed that RNAP spends between 3 and 20 seconds in abortive cycling over a
stretch of 11 bp of DNA before achieving promoter escape
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}.

By singling out the rate limiting steps and finding the distribution of time
spent in abortive cycling, single-molecule experiments have revealed a general
kinetic picture of initial transcription. However, their time-resolution has
not yet been sufficient for distinguishing the rate constants for the
individual steps of backtracking, unscrunching, and abortive RNA release. And
while these methods have been used to quantify the speed of transcription for
transcription elongation \cite{wang_force_1998,
tolic-norrelykke_diversity_2004}, their temporal resolution have yet not
allowed the identification of the speed of the NAC during initial
transcription \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, margeat_direct_2006}. As a
consequence, it is not known if the speed of transcription differs between
promoter-bound and freely elongating RNAPs.

While single-molecule experiments can reveal highly detailed information about
the movement and position of single RNAPs during initial transcription,
traditional bulk experiments must still be used to quantify the relative molar
abundance of abortive transcripts of different lengths. By knowing the
relative abundance of each abortive RNA species, one may calculate the
probability of producing an abortive transcript of a given length, known as
the abortive probability (AP) \cite{hsu_promoter_2002, hsu_quantitative_1996}.
Since backtracking is a starting point for some or all abortive RNA releases,
bulk transcription experiments therefore give a position-specific indication
of the likelihood of backtracking during initial transcription.

In the present study, we have created a kinetic model of initial transcription
that combines the time-distribution of abortive cycling from single-molecule
experiments and abortive probabilities obtained from steady state bulk
experiments. Applying this model, we obtained the rate constants for the NAC
and the combined step of unscrunching and abortive RNA release. Our results
show show that the rate of the NAC is the same for initial transcription as
for elongation elongation, and nearly 10 times faster than the rate-limiting
step of unscrunching and abortive RNA release.
