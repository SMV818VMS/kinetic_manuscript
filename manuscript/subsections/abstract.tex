After promoter binding, RNAP may engage in repeated rounds of initial
transcription and abortive RNA release, known as abortive cycling. The
inherently unstable nature of initial transcription provides a challenging for
extracting kinetic data of key processes of the system, such as the nucleotide
addition cycle and abortive RNA release. Here, we perform a kinetic
investigation of initial transcription using a computational model that
combines findings from both single-molecule and bulk experiments of initial
transcription. We find that the nucleotide addition cycle proceeds at the same
rate for initial transcription as for transcription elongation. In accordance
with previous experimental findings, we identify unscrunching and abortive
transcript release to be the rate limiting step during abortive cycling.
