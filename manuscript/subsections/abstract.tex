In the initial stage of gene expression, promoter-bound RNA polymerase (RNAP)
goes through repeated cycles of abortive RNA synthesis before reaching
promoter escape. In contrast to transcription elongation, where RNAP moves
along the DNA template, initial transcription proceeds through the mechanism
of scrunching, where DNA is pulled into the enzyme, growing the DNA bubble by
one base pair for each nucleotide incorporated into the growing RNA molecule
until promoter escape is reached, or RNA is abortive released. Here, we
investigate the kinetics of initial transcription through a computational
model that combines findings from both single-molecule and bulk transcription
experiments. We identify rate constants for the nucleotide addition cycle and
the combined steps of and unscrunching and abortive RNA release. Our results
indicate that promoter-bound transcription proceeds at the same speed as for
transcription elongation, and that unscrunching and abortive transcript release
are the rate limiting steps for abortive cycling.
