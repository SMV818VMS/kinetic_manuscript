During initial transcription RNA polymerase (RNAP) synthesizes RNA via
scrunching, where DNA is pulled into the enzyme, growing the DNA bubble by one
base pair for each translocation step. Before escaping the promoter, RNAP
may spend prolonged time in unproductive cycles of RNA synthesis,
unscrunching, and abortive RNA release. Abortive cycling is rapid,
and it has been challenging to obtain kinetic parameters for the individual
steps in the process. Here, we investigate the kinetics of initial
transcription by constructing a computational model that combines
findings from both single-molecule and bulk transcription experiments.
Applying the model, we identify rate constants for the nucleotide addition
cycle and the combined steps of and unscrunching and abortive RNA release. Our
results indicate that speed of transcription is the same for promoter-bound
and elongating RNAP, and that unscrunching and abortive transcript release are
the rate limiting steps for abortive cycling.
