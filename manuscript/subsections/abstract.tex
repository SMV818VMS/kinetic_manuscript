After promoter binding, RNAP engages in repeated rounds of synthesis and
abortive RNA release before promoter escape. The inherently unstable
nature of initial transcription has provided a challenging for extracting kinetic
information about the nucleotide addition cycle and abortive RNA release.
Here, we perform a kinetic investigation of initial transcription using a
computational model that combines findings from both single-molecule and bulk
experiments. We find that the nucleotide addition cycle proceeds at the same
rate for initial transcription as for transcription elongation. In accordance
with previous experimental findings, we identify unscrunching and abortive
transcript release to be the rate limiting step during abortive cycling.
