During initial transcription RNA polymerase (RNAP) synthesizes RNA via
scrunching, where DNA is pulled into the enzyme, growing the DNA bubble by one
base pair for each translocation step. Before escaping the promoter, RNAP
may spend prolonged time in unproductive cycles of RNA synthesis,
unscrunching, and abortive RNA release. Due to its rapid dynamics, it has been
challenging to obtain kinetic parameters for initial transcription. Here, we
use a computational model to perform a kinetic investigation of initial
transcription. By combining findings from both single-molecule and bulk
transcription experiments, we are able to obtain rate constants for the
nucleotide addition cycle, the combined steps of and unscrunching and abortive
RNA release. We find that the nucleotide addition cycle proceeds at the same
rate for initial transcription as for transcription elongation, and that
unscrunching and abortive transcript release are the rate limiting steps
for abortive cycling.
