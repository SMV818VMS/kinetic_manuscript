After promoter binding, RNAP may engage in repeated rounds of initial
transcription and abortive RNA release, known as abortive cycling, before
reaching promoter escape. Despite extensive investigation, the multiple steps
and inherently unstable nature of initial transcription makes it challenging
to extract kinetic data of key processes of the system, such as the nucleotide
addition cycle and abortive RNA release. Here, we perform a kinetic
investigation of initial transcription using a compuational model that is
designed to have the best possible fit to experimental data. We find that the
nucleotide addition cycle proceeds at the same rate for initial transcription
as for transcription elongation, and we identify unscrunching and abortive
transcript release as the rate limiting step during abortive cycling. We show
the effect of mutations in the initial transcribed sequence on the halflife of
production of productive transcript.
