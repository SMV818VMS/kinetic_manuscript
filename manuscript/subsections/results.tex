\subsection{Transcription proceeds at the same speed for initial transcription
as for transcription elongation}

We identified the rate constants for initial transcription using a two-step
method. In the first step we performed a broad search by considering the
minimum and maximum values of all rate constants to lie between 1 s$^{-1}$ and
25 s$^{-1}$. By evaluating the model within these values and selecting the
best fitting 1\% of all simulations (see Materials and Methods), we found that
the rate constant for NAC is greater than 7 s$^{-1}$; that the rate
constant for unscrunching and abortive RNA release lies between 1 and 3
s$^{-1}$; and that the rate constant for promoter escape should be greater
than 2.3 s$^{-1}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_proper}A), but the
distribution does not show any clear optimal value. Of these three, the
distribution of values for the rate constant of promoter escape does not
show an optimal value, which indicates that time spent in abortive cycling is
not sensitive to the rate constant for promoter escape
(Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_proper}A).

Having narrowed down the boundaries for the rate constants, we performed a
more focused search in the second step. Since model fitting was insensitive to
the rate constant of promoter escape
(Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_proper}A), we varied only the rate
constants for the NAC and unscrunching and abortive RNA release in this second
round: the NAC between 6 s$^{-1}$ and 14 s$^{-1}$, and unscrunching and
abortive RNA release between 1 s$^{-1}$ and 3 s$^{-1}$, based on the peaks in
the distributions of these values from the first iteration
(Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_proper}A). The rate constant of promoter
escape constant was set to the same as the NAC. The top 1\% best fitting
results from the second round of rate constant estimation resulted in clear
peaks in the distributions for both rate constants. The rate constant for the
NAC showed a peak at 10.4 s$^{-1}$ (Figure
\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_proper}B), which compares well with the speed of
transcription after promoter escape of 9.2 nt/s (positively supercoiled DNA)
and 13.3 nt/s (negatively supercoiled DNA) (Revyakin et al.  Figure S14
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}). This indicates that the speed of the NAC is
unaffected by both RNAP's attachment to the promoter and DNA scrunching. The
rate constant for unscrunching and abortive release showed a peak around 1.4
s$^{-1}$, nearly 10 times slower than the NAC (Figure
\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_proper}B). This lower value is in agreement with
experimental evidence indicating that unscrunching and abortive RNA release
are the rate limiting steps for initial
transcription~\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006, margeat_direct_2006}. The optimal
parameters from the peak of distributions result in a good match between model
and measurements, where nearly all experimental measurements fall within one
standard deviation from the stochastic model mean (Figure
\ref{fig:revyakin_fit}). A full kinetic scheme of the identified rate
constants is given in Figure \ref{fig:estimated_parameters}A.

\subsection{Time spent in short durations of abortive cycling does not follow
    an exponential distribution}
Revyakin et al.\ did not measure cycles of abortive initiation lasting shorter
than ~3.5 seconds, but proposed based on the extrapolation curve that 20\% of
abortive cycles are shorter than one second \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. In
contrast, the best fit by our kinetic model suggests that
less than 2\% of abortive cycling events last shorter than one second, since
~1 second is required by the model for transcribing the first 11 basepairs
when the rate constant of the NAC is 10.4 s$^{-1}$ (Figure
\ref{fig:revyakin_fit}). However, there could also be mechanisms of initial
transcription not yet understood that would make the exponential extrapolation
valid. To test the implication of assuming the exponential extrapolation, we
repeated the rate constant estimation procedure, but fitted to the
extrapolated curve instead of the measurements. This resulted in a similar
optimal rate constant for unscrunching and abortive RNA release, but a much
larger value for the peak for the NAC was found at 23.4 s$^{-1}$ (Figure
\ref{fig:extrap_and_GreB_minus_fit}), which represents what is required in the
model for 20\% of initial transcription events to last shorter than 1 second.

The validity of such a high rate constant for the NAC may be questioned. A
value of 23.4 s$^{-1}$ is twice as high as that reported for transcription
elongation after promoter escape \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. Further, it is
higher than the speed of transcription elongation obtained for substrate
NTP-concentrations ten times as high \cite{bai_mechanochemical_2007}.
Together, this indicates that such a high value for the NAC is
unphysiological, which suggests that it is not valid to extrapolate the
experimental data with an exponential function for abortive cycling lasting
shorter than 3.5 seconds.

\subsection{Estimated rate constants are valid for initial transcription also
in the absence of GreB}
Since the experiments from Revyakin et al. were performed in the presence of
GreB, we originally fitted the model using APs calculated from experiments
also performed in the presence of GreB. However, once fitted, the estimated
constants should be generally valid for initial transcription on the N25
promoter, both in the absence and presence of GreB. When GreB is absent, APs
increase \cite{hsu_initial_2006}, which in our model transfers into larger
rate constants for backtracking (Figure
S\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_scheme}). To test if the rate constants are
valid in the absence of GreB, we compared the model with the half-life of N25
full length (FL) transcript synthesis in the absence of GreB using kinetic data
from Figure 3B in Vo et al.\ \cite{vo_vitro_2003-1}. We fitted the data from
Vo et al.\ to a single exponential function to obtain a half life of FL
transcript synthesis of 13.7 s. We then ran our model with -GreB AP
values using the rate constants estimated for +GreB AP values, which resulted
in generally higher rate constants of backtracking due to the higher AP values
associated with -GreB. This resulted in a model-predicted half-life of FL
transcript synthesis of 16.5 s (Figure~\ref{fig:vo_comparison}), which
is close to value obtained from the experimental data; in contrast, the
half-life when using +GreB APs was 7.0 s. We attribute the
difference between model and experimental curves after 40 seconds
(Figure~\ref{fig:vo_comparison}) to the presence of unproductive complexes in
the experiments that continously synthesize abortive RNA without reaching
promoter escape \cite{vo_vitro_2003-1}; these complexes are not present in the
model. The overall good fit between model and experiments shows that the
estimated rate constants are valid for the kinetics of initial transcription
both in the presence and in the absence of GreB, which indicates that they are
valid in general. The kinetic scheme of the estimated rate constants for
initial transcription on the N25 promoter in the absence of GreB is given in
Figure \ref{fig:estimated_parameters}B.

\subsection{Model performance is highly sensitive to inconsistency in experimental data}
When fitting the model we combined experimental data for time spent in
abortive cycling and APs, where the two datasets were GreB-consistent, in the
sense that they were obtained from transcription experiments performed in the
presence of GreB. If the model correctly represents the kinetics of initial
transcription, the estimation of rate constants should be sensitive to the
consistency of the experimental data. To test this, we re-fitted the
model using the -GreB APs instead of the +GreB APs. This resulted in markedly
different distributions of the rate constants
\ref{fig:extrap_and_GreB_minus_fit}B, with the peak of the distributions being
23.6 s$^{-1}$ and 14.7 s$^{-1}$ for the NAC and unscrunching and abortive RNA
release, respectively. This shows that model is sensitive to inconsistent
experimental data during rate constant estimation.
