\subsection{The forward pathway of transcription proceeds at the same rate
for initial transcription as for elongation}
Revyakin et.\ al measured initial transcription on the N25 promoter in the
presence of GreB and 100 $\mu$M NTP and found that abortive cycling lasts on
average 5 seconds prior to promoter escape~\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. We
constructed a kinetic model and fitted it to this distribution together with the
APs of +GreB from bulk studies of initial transcription from
Hsu et. al~\cite{hsu_initial_2006}, and thus obtained average rate constants
for NAC, promoter escape, and unscrunhcing (Figure~\ref{fig:revyakin_fit},
Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivity}). This resulted in the following values:~NAC
$10.5 s^{-1} \pm 0.64$; escape $11.84 s^{-1} \pm 1.81$; and unscrunching $1.58 s^{-1} \pm
0.14$ (Figure \ref{fig:parameter_estimation}). The value for NAC before
promoter escape is highly similar to the transcription velocity after promoter
escape: 9.5 nt/s for positively supercoiled DNA and 13.8 nt/s for negatively
supercoiled DNA~\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. This indicates that NAC
proceeds at the same rate for both scrunching and transcription elongation.
The comparatively lower rate of 1.58/s for unscrunching, including abortive
RNA release, is consistent with previous reports that this process is rate
limiting for initial transcription~\cite{margeat_direct_2006,
revyakin_abortive_2006}.  Revyakin et.\ al did not measure rounds of abortive
cycling that lasted shorter than 1 second, but proposed based on extrapolation
of their data that 20\% of abortive cycles last shorter than one second
\cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. The best fit to the data by our kinetic model
suggests that less than 2\% of abortive cycling rounds last shorter than 1
second (Figure \ref{fig:revyakin_fit}). This number can be understood by
considering that with a transcription rate of $10.5$~nt/s one second is the
average time needed to reach promoter escape on N25 if backtracking is
avoided.

\subsection{Estimated rate constants are also valid for -GreB kinetics}
We estimated the rate constants of NAC, escape, and scrunching for the
APs associated with +GreB. However, once fitted, the rate constants should
be generally valid. The fitted model should therefore be able to capture the
kinetics of transcription on N25 for different APs, such as the
one obtained for transcription under -GreB conditions, for which the abortive
probability is considerably higher \cite{hsu_initial_2006}. To test this, we
used the estimated rate constants to simulate initial transcription for
-GreB conditions. We compared the simulation result with the kinetics
of FL transcript synthesis reported by Vo et.\ al \cite{vo_vitro_2003-1}.
The half-life of FL transcript synthesis, denoted $\tau$, was 15.5 seconds in
the simulation, and determined to be 13.7 seconds in the experiment after
fitting measurements to a single exponential (Figure~\ref{fig:vo_match}).
While these numbers appear close, there is no other kinetic data for the N25
promoter in the literature which can tell us the range of values of $\tau$ for
different APs. To be able to compare the accuracy of the match,
we therefore compared with $\tau$ values from simulations of N25 promoter
variants with a modified ITS. We simulated the kinetics of FL transcript
synthesis for N25 variants N25-anti and N25A1-anti, which have previously been
shown to vary from N25 in several quantitative parameters for initial
transcription~
\cite{hsu_initial_2006,chan_anti-initial_2001,kammerer_functional_1986}. This
showed that the simulated and experimentally determined $\tau$ values for
-GreB are highly similar compared to the values for the other two N25 ITS
variants \ref{fig:its_variant_fl_comparison}.

\subsection{Estimated rate constants are sensitive to changes to the +GreB 
APs}
In estimating the rate constants, we have used APs from
bulk studies together with an abortive cycling distribution obtained from
single-molecule studies. This relies on the assumption that the APs for the
single-molecule experiments is the same as the one obtained by bulk studies.
That this holds true is not certain, since the rapid kinetics of initial
transcription prevents direct observation of the exact position of
backtracking and abortive RNA release \cite{margeat_direct_2006,
revyakin_abortive_2006}. One way to assess the similarity of the two abortive
profiles is to investigate the sensitivity of the estimated rate constants to
changes in the APs. We consider the rate constants in Table
\ref{tab:xxx} to be physiological and consistent with the available
literature; therefore, if the rate rate constants become unphysiological or
model predictions worsen when attempting fitting to perturbed APs, this
is an indication that there is likely an agreement between the probability to
abort RNA along the ITS single-molecule and bulk experiments. To investigate
this, we first repeated the parameter estimation process using the -GreB APs
instead of +GreB APs \cite{hsu_initial_2006}. This led to an estimate for the
rate constant of NAC of $23.2 s^{-1} \pm 0.4$
(Table~\ref{tab:param_fit_revyakin}), which we consider unphysiological since
it would suggest that NAC proceeds twice as fast during scrunching compared to
elongation, proceeding at speeds normally found for NTP concentrations of 1000
$\mu$M~\cite{bai_mechanochemical_2007}, 10 times higher than actual
experimental conditions. Next, we asked how model fitting would be affected by
gradually modifying the +GreB APs to make them increasingly removed from the
original values. We therefore re-estimated rate constants after changing the
+GreB Aps so that the probability to abort became first gradually higher and
then gradually lower compared to the original values. This showed first
of all that the fit is best for zero or small perturbations, and gets
progressively worse as peturbations increase (Figure
\ref{fig:ap_adjustment}A), which shows that the original +GreB AP values lie
in an optimal region in terms of fitting to the experimental data. The effect
of perturbations on the rate constants were as follows: for higher AP, NAC is
forced to increase to maintain optimal fit, while NAC decreases when AP is
lowered, (Figure \ref{fig:ap_adjustment}B); for higher APs, the rate constant
for unscrunching and abortive release similarly increased as AP increases, to
the point where this step becomes nearly as rapid as the NAC, but for lower AP
this value was not much removed from the baseline (Figure
\ref{fig:ap_adjustment}C). The rate constant for promoter escape was
insensitive to changes in AP, indicating that model performance is insensitive
to this parameter (Figure \ref{fig:ap_adjustment}D).

We therefore observed that for an increased AP, the rate constant for NAC
increased to the point of being unphysiological at more than 20 $s^{-1}$, and
the rate constant for the abortive step increased to the point of being
similar in size to that of the NAC, where it is hardly rate limiting for the
process. However, for a reduced AP there is no criteria by which to judge the
rate constants as unphysiological. Therefore, we wished to assess how model
performance was affected by rate constants that were optimal for low APs. To
do so, we used each set of rate constants obtained after modifying the APs to
obtain $\tau$ for -GreB APs, and calculated the size of this value relative to
the one obtained from measurements from Vo et. al \cite{vo_vitro_2003-1},
denoted $\tau_r$. This showed that when AP is changed from the original +GreB
values, $\tau$ becomes increasingly removed from the value obtained by
measurements (Figure \ref{fig:ap_adjustment}E), with the baseline value lying
between minimal and maximal values, in the region of a ratio of 1.

% If you end up short with things in the results section, add something here
% about the sensitivity of the parameters. Define sensitivity as how much the
% value can be varied +/- before a 5% change in best fit is reached?

% Can we say that because the NAC is similar to elongation NAC, and that the
% ensemble experiment was so closely matched, that our two main assumptions
% are justified:
    % 1) that each backtracking event leads to an abortive release?
    % 2) that -GreBassisted cleavage and RNA release is rapid enough to be
    % negligeble for the oveall kinetics of the system?

%But how do we interpret the AP for the +GreB experiments? This is a bit of a
%conundrum. We are interpreting them as if GreB results in a reduction of
%the probability of backtracking at each position. That is OK, though, because
%then we only count the unscrunching steps that have proceeded without
%influence by GreB. We thus assume that rescue upon backtracking is fast
%enough.
