The enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP) is responsible for reading the genetic code.
It travels along DNA, producing RNA molecules that may in turn be used to make
protein. To begin reading DNA, RNAP must first bind tighly to a promoter
region of DNA. Since it is bound to the promoter, RNAP cannot immediately
travel along DNA when it begins to produce RNA. Instead, when the first part
of RNA is made, DNA must be pulled into RNAP. As more and more DNA is pulled
in, strain builds up. One way this strain can be released is if DNA goes out
again from within the enzyme. If so, the short RNA made becomes released from
RNAP and RNA production must start over. This all happens very fast, which has
made it difficult to measure the speed of the process. In this paper, we have
made a kinetic model for the repeated production and release of short RNAs
from promoter bound RNAPs. By comparing with experimental data, we find that
promoter bound RNAP makes RNA at the same speed as promoter-free RNAP. This
implies that the strain of pulling in DNA does not affect the reaction steps
involved in RNA synthesis.
