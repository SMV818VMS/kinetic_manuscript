Text for Figure 7:

One cycle of the rate constant estimation protocol. \textbf{1:} Rate constants for
the NAC, UAR and promoter escape are randomly sampled from a uniform
distribution (example values are shown). Of these values, the NAC is used
further to obtain backtracking rates at each template position (\textbf{3}).
This is done by solving equation \eqref{eq:backtrackingcalc}, inserting for
each position the associated AP value for the N25 promoter from Hsu et al.\
\cite{hsu_initial_2006} (\textbf{2}). The distinct backtracking rate constants
at each position are then combined with the NAC, UAR, and promoter escape rate
constants sampled in step \textbf{1} to obtain a complete kinetic scheme of
initial transcription (\textbf{4}). This scheme is then used to simulate the
kinetics of 100 initial transcription events; from these 100 events the
distribution of time spent in abortive cycling is calculated and compared to
measured data from Revyakin et al.\ \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}
(\textbf{5}). From the distance between the measured distribution and the
simulated distribution, a fitness score is produced. This score is associated
to the three randomly selected rate constants in step \textbf{1}, and is a
measure for how well the kinetic scheme with these rate constants (together
with the AP values) agree with the experimental data. By repeating steps
\textbf{1}-\textbf{5} multiple times, distributions are obtained showing which values
of rate constants have the best fitness to experimental data (Figures
\ref{fig:parameter_estimation_proper} and \ref{fig:extrap_and_GreB_minus_fit})
