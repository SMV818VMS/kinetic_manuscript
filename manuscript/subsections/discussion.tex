In this work we have used a kinetic model to show that promoter-bound
transcription by RNAP before promoter escape proceeds at around 10.6 nt/s
(\FIGS~\ref{fig:estimated_parameters}~and~\ref{fig:revyakin_fit}), highly
similar to the speed found for transcription elongation after promoter
escape \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}. We found that the steps of unscrunching
and abortive RNA release are nearly ten times slower, proceeding at around 1.4
s$^{-1}$. These rate constants were validated by comparing with kinetic data
obtained under experimental conditions different to those to which the model
was fitted (\FIG~\ref{fig:vo_comparison}).

% Explain the meaning of the study
Knowing the rate constants of initial transcription is important for the overall
understanding of the mechanism of promoter-bound RNA synthesis and abortive
cycling. It has been proposed that the cause of both abortive RNA release and
promoter escape is the release of built-up energy caused by the strain of the
increasingly enlarged DNA bubble \cite{straney_stressed_1987,
hsu_promoter_2002, revyakin_abortive_2006}. While the precise nature of this
strain has not been identified, it is clear that it is unrelated to the free
energy of the DNA-DNA bubble or the RNA-DNA hybrid \cite{hsu_initial_2006,
skancke_sequence-dependent_2015}. It has instead been suggested that this
strain manifests itself through bulges in the template-strand of DNA, which
may contribute to the obligate displacement of different parts of $\sigma$
before promoter escape \cite{winkelman_crosslink_2015}. In our study, we have
shown that this strain does not have a marked impact on the rate of
transcription. In other words, our model predicts that the reactions in the
NAC (translocation, NTP binding, and pyrophosphorolysis) are not delayed
because of strain in RNAP and the presence of scrunched DNA. We have further
showed that the time spent in short abortive cycles ($< 3.5$ seconds) does not
follows an exponential distribution, as originally suggested by Revyakin et
al.\ \cite{revyakin_abortive_2006}, since this would require an
unphysiologically large rate constant of the NAC of 23.4 s$^{-1}$ in order to
fit the distribution curve (\FIG~\ref{fig:extrap_and_GreB_minus_fit}A).
Instead, using the rate constant of the NAC obtained by simply fitting to the
measured data, the distribution of time spent in abortive cycling is predicted
to contain a transient delay of about one second before the first promoter
escape events come to pass (\FIG~\ref{fig:revyakin_fit}).

% Relate the findings to similar studies
The most similar study to the work presented here is a study of the kinetics
of initial transcription with the T7 RNAP by Tang et al.
\cite{tang_real-time_2009}. Using time-series data, they discerned rate
constants for the individual translocation steps, showing a 10-fold variation
for the NAC rate constant, from 6 nt/s to 60 nt/s
\cite{tang_real-time_2009}. In our model, we have used an average value for
the NAC at all translocation steps. This raises the question if there is a
similar variation in the rate constant of the NAC for \textit{E. coli} RNAP.
Since the average rate constant we obtained coincided closely with the speed
during transcription elongation, we would argue that a large variation is
not likely for \textit{E. coli}. If the speed during transcription
elongation represents an upper limit of what may be achieved for
promoter-bound RNAP, there is little room for individual steps at a speed much
lower than 10 nt/s, since this would have to be compensated for by other
steps where the speed is much higher than 10 nt/s in order to maintain the
average value. Therefore, if there are any individual NACs during initial
transcription that are slow, for example during displacement of
$\sigma_{3,2}$, they are not likely to be much slower than the average. Our
results therefore support a model where there is no strong bottleneck step for
the NAC during initial transcription, implying that the strain of the growing
DNA bubble and steric clashes with $\sigma$ do not greatly affect the NAC.
Instead, we our results are consistent with a model where transcription during
initiation proceeds similarly as for elongation except for a higher
probability to backtrack.

% Acknowledge limitations
A limitation of the current study is that it does not capture the likely
variation in the rate constant of unscrunching and abortive RNA release from
ITCs with RNAs of varying lengths. It is known that GreB cannot
contribute to the rescue of backtracked complexes with RNAs shorter than 5 nt
\cite{hsu_initial_2006}, which implies an RNA-length-dependence in the rate of
unscrunching and abortive RNA release. Work on elongation complexes have shown
that a weakened RNA-DNA hybrid prevents backtracking
\cite{nudler_rnadna_1997}, making it likely that unscrunching takes longer for
a complete compared to a partially formed RNA-DNA hybrid. To resolve this
number more precisely, experimental techniques are needed that can resolve
backtracking and abortive RNA release at the time scale in which they occur.
Alternatively, as increasingly complex molecular simulations of RNAP dynamics
are obtained \cite{silva_millisecond_2014}, the details of the rapid kinetics
of abortive cycling may be instead first be obtained using numerical methods
alone.

In conclusion, this work supports a model of initial transcription where the
forward rate of transcription is highly similar to the rate for transcription
elongation, and where the backtracking and abortive release step is nearly 10
times slower. Since model fitting resulted in physiologically meaningful rate
constants, and since these rate constants held up to independent kinetic data
(\FIG~\ref{fig:vo_comparison}), this supports that the underlying assumption
that APs reflect the probability to backtrack is sound. This supports that
these values may be considered for future modelling work to investigate the
mechanisms behind the large variation in abortive RNA synthesis that occurs
from one template position to the next \cite{hsu_initial_2006}.
