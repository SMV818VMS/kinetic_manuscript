Points to discuss:

* What errors are we incurring by using AP to find rate of backtracking? What
are the assumptions (For GreB +/-).
    - Assumption1: backtracking leads to rapid abortive RNA release, and each
    backtracking event leads to abortive RNA release at similar rates. This
    has got to be an approximation, judging from the action of GreB.
    - Assumption2: rescue by GreB is fast

In spite of these simplifying assumption, the model has done well.
