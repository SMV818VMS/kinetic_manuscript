1) Kinetic competition: NAC and backtracking are in kinetic competition by
defitition: it's a constraint in the model. I have added an extra step in
deriving the equation for the rate constant of backtracking. You argued that a
high NAC should prevent high rates of backtracking, but this is not the case.
It is the AP (experimentally obtained) which decides the balance between NAC
and backtracking. The total flux is NAC + backtracking, and AP is just
backtracking / total flux.

2) Stochastic simulations. Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA)
is well known by modellers of biochemical kinetics modelling, so I don't think
any further introduction is needed. The basis for the theory is that chemical
reactions are assumed to be random and independent. The probability of having
one reaction happen over another is given by the reaction rate expression. See
the wikipedia-article for an introduction.

3) I tried looking into different optimalization packages, but I concluded
that there was not much to gain. This is because these simulations are cheap,
so I can cover the entire parameter space densely, so there is no real need
for optimization.
