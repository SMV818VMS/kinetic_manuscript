% You have added two cfg files. One uses zip, but there must be a bug
% in bundledoc because the zip file is not deleted from /tmp and not
% moved to the workind directory. The file seems fine so I think
% you can just move it manually. The other cfg file works but
% produces a tar.gz file which is not convenient for Biochemistry
% submission.
